# Elixir
### About
> I'm loving learning Elixir, and through it I'm discovering more about the world of computing, focusing on concepts and ideas. Currently studying through its own documentation and whenever possible looking for new content to understand why the language is so amazing, such as the way processes communicate "Actor model" and also about functional programming.

> Note: I will always add content to this repository, focusing on organizing what I'm studying in a modularized way, sharing my process of learning Erlang/Elixir <3
